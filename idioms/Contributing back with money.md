Contributing back with money
============================

While the D phenomenon relies primarily on benevolent effort, a bit of money can go a long way towards enhancing documentation, supporting libraries, compilers and IDEs.

**If your company depends on a healthy D ecosystem**, your donations will have a noticeable impact in spreading D to the programming world, while hedging against related technology risks.


## The D Foundation

The D Language Foundation is a 501(c) non-profit public charity devoted to advancing open source technology related to the D programming language.

A one-stop shop for pushing the interests of the D world at large.

## LDC

The LDC project is pivotal to many D companies that profit from top performance.
If you are one of them, consider giving back to this critical infrastructure 
piece that makes your product exist in the first place.
