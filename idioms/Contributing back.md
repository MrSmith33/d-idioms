# Contributing back with money

While the D phenomenon relies primarily from benevolent effort, 
a bit of money can go a long way towards enhancing documentation, 
supporting libraries, compilers and IDEs.

**If your company depends on a healthy D ecosystem**, your donations will 
have a noticeable impact in spreading D to the programming world, while
hedging against D technology risks.


## The D Foundation

A one-stop shop for pushing the interests of the D world at large.

The D Language Foundation is a 501(c) non-profit public charity devoted
